# Notes
I've attempted to make an editor tool to setup ships' layouts with the new UI Toolkit that Unity provides nowadays.  
I've never made an editor tool before. So that took a while and it's probably not in the best shape. But it was fun to learn it and get out of the comfort zone, even though a bit frustraiting. Wanted to explore it for a while now. But there's a lot to learn for me about this aspect of development with Unity.
